I have always been doing things before anyone else(the ones I know) does in my age Like, School, Job, Business, Marriage(probably).

Similarly, I stopped watching the news in the early stage of my life. I was just a normal FAT kid but my interested were a bit different than others.

I used to watch TV a lot, almost 8-10 hours a day. I was tired of watching the cartoons and other fun stuff. I was more interested in increasing the intelligence.
Once an old man told me that Reading newspapers and watching news increases the knowledge and I started doing that. **Acquiring Knowledge changes your perception of life.**

I was about 11 years old when I started watching the news all the time. I used to spread the news with my friends when we meet to play cricket. They were amused and I felt more intelligent amongst them.

But most of the news I was consuming was just crap. For sure they were **negative**, but most of them were kind of fake.

I used to watch a lot of news about **Paranormal activities, Aliens,** and some fake but amusing stuff.

One day, I shared a news which I saw on India TV with my teacher. He was so nice and he told me that the news is fake and I should stop watching this stuff.
I was kind of unhappy with the reaction of my teacher. He also proved that the news was fake.

Even though I was shown the proof that these news channels are spreading fake news just for their profit, I continued to watch news channels.

Every time we met, I shared some news with him and he always proved that the news is wrong.

After a handful of proofs, I decided that I should watch something else than news channels.

I was not interested in what is going bad in the world, I was interested in creating and learning.
I, later on, started watching **Discovery Channel, Discovery Science, Nat Geo,** and all those informational channels where I learned something new every day.

Following is an amazing video by **DominickQTV** explaining demerits of watching the news and why you should stop watching the news.
New Year is coming and this can be your New Year's Resolution.
